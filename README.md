# Summary
A script to pull Ancillary Service (AS) prices from the CAISO OASIS API.  The API is finicky, read print statements for possible missing data from the API.  Need to contact CAISO Support about it but you can check the API documentation here for reference: https://www.caiso.com/Documents/OASIS-Frequently-Asked-Questions.pdf

# How to use
- download the script
- change the year/month params (line 10-14) to the years/month you want to pull
- run

# Objective
Planning to use AS price in Energy/AS co-optimization, coming soon.
